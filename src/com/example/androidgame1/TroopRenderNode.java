/**
 * Here is how it works. A subset of Troop data gets copied to a render node - 
 * info that is useful for rendering and nothing else. This limits
 * data that needs to be copied, decreases memory requirements, etc.
 * Drawing code can be arbitrarily complex, including text and sprites and all that...
 * Helper utility functions increase usability of code.
 * 
 * A possible scheme of increasing flexibility is to have nodes return a draw list.
 * The draw list is a list of render items that are sprites.
 * Question: Is there anything more than sprites needed? Maybe text? Maybe generated point fx?
 * Changing material? etc etc....
 * 
 * What about scalability to 3D meshes?
 * 
 * One other thing, these are all nodes with common interface.
 * 
 * DEPRECATED
