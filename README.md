### Take a look

[What this game currently looks like.](http://eric.buzz/tenthgame) 

Currently it is a 2D, RTS-like toy with no game mechanic. That is a todo.


### Your own Game

The code is a fair mess. 
Because it tries to be functional, it should be doable to convert this project 
into a game of your own design fairly easily. 

At the very least, there is some almost-decent boilerplate for a 2D game.
